     <p> We sepent 3 days/2 nights in Yosemite. Sadly we did not see any bears. Beautiful as Yoesemite was, it was very busy and there were a lot of people and cars which spoilt the whole atmosphere. Once you got out treking you could easily escape the people and feel like you were in you own wilderness. The scenery was breath taking and it is definately worth going on an all day hike.</p>
