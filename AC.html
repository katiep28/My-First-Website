     <h1 class="title"> Antelope Canyon </h1>
     <p> Antelope Canyon is located on the Indian Navajo Reservation. The canyon is underground and is subject to flooding when the weather is bad. Fortunately the weather was good when we were there. The grooves and curves in the sandstone were incredible and the gaps in the roof of the canyon created images and shapes.</p>
