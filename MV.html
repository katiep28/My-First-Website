     <p> Monument Valley was one of the main places I wanted to visit. I am a big Star Trek fan and it has appeared in some episodes as well as appearing in westerns which I watched as a child. We camped overnight in Monument Valley and saw the sun rise over the butes, which was one of the most spectacular things I have ever seen.</p>
